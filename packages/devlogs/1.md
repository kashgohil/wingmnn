### DB setup issue
i moved the db into a new package and initialized it there only. the issue is - when i import it in my backend package and try to run it, it does not work. mistake i was making was - i did not setup the database url in my backend package's `.env` file. because of this, db was initializing with my username and it was not connecting to actual db.

then i ran into another problem - this time in cache implementation. so i created a hook that subscribes to the state directly from the query cache. but because i was accessing a key before it was actually set, i was getting undefined every time. because it was unset at the time of invocation, i was not able to even subscribe to the later changes of that key. so i had to add an undefined value in the cache with subscriber attached to it. now, whenever that value changes in the future, i will get notified.

so everything up until now was working. but then i found another issue. my query was not using cache and instead it iwas making new network call everytime. so dug deeper in the query code and found out that i was appliying the cache value to `this.#result` but after that, i was not returning from the executor. so, i exited the executor once result was set from the cache. and voila, it worked!!
