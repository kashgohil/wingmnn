### Setup Mails service
i added gmail service today. i can fetch emails with pagination, fetch drafts with pagination, fetch threads with pagination using this service. it also supports individual mail fetching (which is required because gmail only gives id and threadId in messages.list, so i need to fetch each mail individually). service supports sending mails, managing drafts and using drafts to send the mails as well. then there is support for all the actions (like star, archive, delete, trash etc).

things that were interesting for me were forwarding support and threads/reply support. it needs id of the message you are replying/forwarding to. reply needs to add 'Re:' in the subject. forwarding needs to add all the metadata of the message at the top. and then when you are parsing the body, you need to convert it into base64 encoded raw string.

then, i asked agent to add test cases for this. initially, it added test cases using jest library but i did not want to add new library. so i asked it to use bun for test cases. it got stuck there for some time but eventually it came through. i ran the tests and it passed all of them. i need to go through the test once and see if it has any missing cases. will do that today.

i also added a quotes directory. it will contain all the quotes i want to show when loading the screen.
